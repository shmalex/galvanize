Task 8 - Mean, Median, and Mode (Computed From Scratch)
1) Write a function that, given an arbitrary list of numbers (or a range, or a tuple of numbers) computes the mean.
2) Write a function that, given an arbitrary list of numbers (or a range of numbers, or a tuple of numbers) computes the median.
3) Write a function that, given an arbitrary list of numbers (or a range, or a tuple of numbers) computes the mode.
see docstring below for examples

>>> mode(list1) = None
