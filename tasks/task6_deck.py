Task #9 for beginning of Monday's class. Design a Python class called Card, and then  a Python class called Deck that represents a deck of cards. The cards should have four suits (hearts spades clubs and diamonds) and go from 2 to Ace like normal playing cards. 

Make a list of attributes and methods that your Card and Deck classes should have, and implement them as time permits.
